PART FOUR: CLASS EXERCISES           *
**************************************
#
1.  Use the ozone.data.csv datafile:
# 		(a) use the datafile called airquality;
#		(b) explore the data to look at its structure, normality, linearity, heterogeneity;
#		(c) create coplots to look for interactions between the variables;
# 		(d) create a multiplicative linear model to illustrate the what factors influences ozone levels in the city;
#		(e) Use model averaging to select the most parsimonious model;
#		(f) validate the 'best' model;
#		(g) create the predictive model and generate the regression equation.

#ozone.data.csv DATAFILE CONTENTS:
# Based on Daily readings of the following air quality values for May 1, 1973 (a Tuesday)
# to September 30, 1973 in New York.
# 
# Response - ozone: Mean ozone in parts per billion from 1300 to 1500 hours at Roosevelt Island
# Explanatory - rad: Solar radiation in Langleys in the frequency band 4000â€“7700 Angstroms from 0800-1200 hours at Central Park
# Explanatory - wind: Average wind speed in miles per hour at 0700 and 1000 hours at LaGuardia Airport
# Explanatory - temp: Maximum daily temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at La Guardia Airport

Load your libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse) # for wrangling
library(ggfortify)
library(car)
library(MuMIn)
```


# Load file (you already have the data!): File is ozone.data.csv
```{r}
Ozone <- read.csv(file.choose(), header = TRUE)
```
# look at data structure

```{r}
glimpse(Ozone)
```

# Draw pictures to explore it....
# Boxplots - normality
```{r}
op <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
boxplot(Ozone$ozone, ylab="Ozone")
boxplot(Ozone$rad, ylab = "Solar Radiation")
boxplot(Ozone$wind, ylab = "Wind")
boxplot(Ozone$temp, ylab = "Temperature")
par(op)
```
# Generally okay; wind and ozone have a few extreme values but it should be fine
# relationships between response and explanatories

```{r}
scatterplotMatrix(~ozone + rad + wind + temp, data = Ozone, diagonal = list(method = "qqplot")) # use qqplot not boxplot
```
# Mixture of humped and linear x/Y relationships. 
# Ozone ~ rad looks quadratic....ozone and rad slightly off normal. 
# Might consider log10 transform if models are a mess.
# QQplots indicate that O2 and rad are a problem

# generate first full model using linear function. The full model uses all the interactions.
```{r}
M1 <- lm(ozone ~ rad * wind * temp, data = Ozone)
```
# look at summary
```{r}
summary(M1)
```
# Nothing appears to be significant. 
# need to simplify this a little....but first we need to check for inflationary values
# Note that any exponent will lead to inflation....

```{r}
vif(lm(ozone ~ rad * wind * temp, data = Ozone))
```
# but interaction terms are huge so remove the 3-way and largest 2-ways ones.
vif(lm(ozone ~ rad + wind + temp+ wind:temp, data = Ozone))
# Chuck out wind as it is huge leaving the interaction with wind and temp.
# Our understanding how wind impacts temperature and ozone production suggests this is sensible.

```{r}
vif(lm(ozone ~ rad + temp + wind:temp, data = Ozone))
```
# no issues

```{r}
M2 <- lm(ozone ~ rad + temp + wind:temp, data = Ozone)
summary(M2)
```
#validate
```{r}
op <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(M2)
par(op)
```
# ggfortify autoplot
```{r}
autoplot(M2)
```
# It's a mess.....heterogeneous residuals [see the clear wedge shape?] and not especially normally distributed

# Use MuMIn to sort out the modelling - note the options commmand must sit within the script window otherwise it will not work
```{r}
options(na.action=na.fail) # set options in Base R concerning missing values
M3 <- model.avg(dredge(M2, rank = "AICc")) # code introduces model.avg(), get.models and dredge functions
options(na.action = "na.omit") # reset base R options
summary(M3)
```
# best models > 2 AICc includes ALL variables, so it is no different from the one above
# As a result the residuals are still a mess...

# AT THIS POINT WE MIGHT REFLECT ON HOW WE MODEL THESE DATA AND ADD IN SOME QUADRATICS AND MAYBE USE
# GENERALISED LINEAR APPROACHES, SUCH AS POISSON REGRESSION. BUT WE'LL COME ONTO THAT IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS
# we go back to a linear model and transform the response 

```{r}
M4 <- lm(log10(ozone) ~ rad + temp + wind:temp, data = Ozone)
summary(M4)
```

# Validate the model
```{r}
op <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(M4)
par(op)
```
# ggfortify autoplot
```{r}
autoplot(M4)
```

# looks pretty good...
# plot residuals against explanatory variables....

```{r}
op <- par(mfrow = c(2,2)) # We cannot use the exponents here!
plot(M4$resid ~ Ozone$rad) 	# Looks okay
plot(M4$resid ~ Ozone$temp)	# Looks okay
plot(M4$resid ~ Ozone$wind)	# Looks okay
par(op)
```
# We could now do some plotting / prediction.....but I'll leave that code up to you

# NOTE: you'll get a very similar outcome if you model without the interaction. And no one would complain!
```{r}
M5 <- lm(log10(ozone) ~ rad + temp + wind, data = Ozone)
op <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(M5)
par(op)
```
# Make more sense to select the model with the lowest AIC
```{r}
AIC(M4,M5)
```
# M4 with interaction has the lowest AIC (it's negative!) [but note it is within 2 AIC points so you could go with the simple additive model]
# plus the residual plots for M4 are slightly better

Introduction to Generalised linear modelling

This is essentially the same as linear modelling but you need to test for one further element - overdispersion. I'll introduce you to this test and the generation of psuedo R2 values [glms don't produce R2 out of the bag] to get you started. We'll do it using the package call performance. You'll need to install it.

```{r}
library(performance)
```

Our routine here:
1. standard exploration work
2. Check VIFs
3. run glm using the correct error term
4. test for overdispersion if you are using a poisson or binomial model
5. If it is exists run a negative binomial model [from the library MASS]. Has the same syntax but the call command is glm.nb()
6. Do the model selection. MuMiN will work with all variants
7. Validate as normal

Here is an example using the dataset above

```{r}
M6 <- glm(ozone ~ rad + temp + wind:temp, family=gaussian, data = Ozone) 
summary(M6)
```
Check effect sizes/model performance using guesstimate R2 Nagelkerke's algorithm
```{r}
#check effect sizes/model performance using guesstimate R2 Nagelkerke's
r2(M6) # 0.627
```
You can use MuMIn to model average the data
```{r}
options(na.action=na.fail) # set options in Base R concerning missing values
M7 <- model.avg(dredge(M6, rank = "AICc")) # code introduces model.avg(), get.models and dredge functions
options(na.action = "na.omit") # reset base R options
summary(M7)
```
Give us the same outcome. Now proceed to validate as above all the code will work
```{r}
autoplot(M6) 
```
- Note autoplot cannot use model averaged elements. So do that then select the final model re-rerun as we did above and validate that one.

******************************
Let's pretend it is count data
******************************

```{r}
M8<- glm(ozone ~ rad + temp + wind:temp, family=poisson, data = Ozone) 
summary(M8)
```
Run overdispersion test
```{r}
#Check for over/under dispersion
check_overdispersion(M8)
```
It is present. This means that the variance in the data is greater than the mean. We must control for that.The way we do it is to use the negative binomial model [it's an exponent based approach]

Proceed with negative biominal model

```{r}
library(MASS)
M9 <- glm.nb(ozone ~ rad + temp + wind:temp, data = Ozone) 
summary(M9)
```
You can use MuMin to model select
```{r}
options(na.action=na.fail) # set options in Base R concerning missing values
M10 <- model.avg(dredge(M9, rank = "AICc")) # code introduces model.avg(), get.models and dredge functions
options(na.action = "na.omit") # reset base R options
summary(M10)
```
As one might expect we end up with the same basic model. So select your final model. rerun it as a glm.nb and validate as above.
