title: "Formative solution - R Notebook"

**I am leaving these commands in so you can make a start on R notebooks and markdown**.

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

**CODE Starts here:**

Load libraries we need.  
note '#' symbol is only needed within the code blocks. Outside of them the format is controlled via Markdown language.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(car)
library(ggsignif) # new library you'll need to install it.
library(dplyr) 
library(tidyr)
```

Load the data - this is my WD. You need to set yours or use file.choose()
```{r}
setwd("/Users/jonathansadler/Dropbox/My Mac (Jonathans-MacBook-Pro.local)/Downloads")
pred <- read.csv("fish_pred.csv", header = TRUE)
```
Look at the data.

```{r}
glimpse(pred)
head(pred)
View(pred)
```

We see that the bullhead/loach columns are character fields - you'll not get all the validation plots if you don't use factors change character fields to factors. 

```{r}
pred$Bullhead <- as.factor(pred$Bullhead)
pred$Loach <- as.factor(pred$Loach)
glimpse(pred) # check it worked
```

Check for balance necessary for a two-way ANOVA
```{r}
table(pred$Bullhead, pred$Loach)
```
Fine so we can go with 2 way ANOVA (as we have one response and two FACTORS)
Note - the fish are either present or absent....

Draw some pictures. Boxplots:
```{r}
op <- par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) # 1 row , 2 columns for the images
boxplot(Density ~ Bullhead, col = "lightblue", data = pred, xlab = "Bullhead")
boxplot(Density ~ Loach, col = "lightblue", data = pred, xlab = "Loach")
par(op)
```

Or in ggplot - need to transform the data to a long format to do this easily.
```{r}
pred_long <- pred %>% gather(species,treatment, 1:2)
glimpse(pred_long) 
```
It looks fine we'll flip new variables to factors as we're going to create error bars plots 

```{r}
pred_long <- pred_long %>% mutate(species = factor(species),treatment = factor(treatment)) # use glimpse(pred_long) to check it worked
```

Create first plot
```{r}
ggplot(pred_long, aes(y=Density, x=species, fill=treatment)) + geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Fish species", y = "Prey Density", fill = "Treatment") 
```
Variances look okay and the pattern indicates that Loach reduce midge density but Bullheads don't.

Check assumptions:
- 1. normality
```{r}
qqnorm(pred$Density); qqline(pred$Density)
shapiro.test(pred$Density)
```
Data are normally distributed....

- 2. Homogeneity of variance
```{r}
leveneTest(pred$Density ~ pred$Bullhead * pred$Loach) # No issues visible
```

Check for possible interaction effects
```{r}
interaction.plot(pred$Bullhead, pred$Loach, pred$Density, col=c(2,3), xlab = "Predators", ylab = "Midge Density", trace.label = "")
```
Indicates no interaction but it is sensible to include the interaction in the plot anyway

Run ANOVA:
```{r}
pred_aov <- aov(Density ~ Loach * Bullhead, data = pred)
```
Look at the output
```{r}
summary(pred_aov)
```
Results indicate that Loach reduces midge density but bullheads don't. There is no interaction between the two explanatories (or the fish), so the addition of bullheads to the cages did not result in greater impact on midge density.

Confirm all diagnostics [Remember you can use the autoplot function too, but you'll need to load the ggfortify library]
```{r}
op <- par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) # set graphics device to plot four graphs in a 2 x 2 matrix
plot(pred_aov)
par(op)
```
No big issues. There are no worrying patterns in residuals data point 13 stands out. So we'll look at it via leverage/Cook's Distance outlier plots.

```{r}
plot(pred_aov, which=6) # plots leverage and cook's plot
```
It's dancing on the margin but okay.....if you remove them nothing changes!

Final task:
Plot barchart with error bars to show the pattern for a report - we'll go for a publication level type file and output it to a file at high resolution. We'll use ggplot and the reshaped dataframe pred_long.

Calculate the mean, sd, se and IC
```{r}
pred_sum <- pred_long %>%
  group_by(species,treatment) %>%
  summarise( 
    n=n(),
    mean=mean(Density),
    sd=sd(Density)) %>%
  mutate( se=sd/sqrt(n))  %>% # computes the standard error
  mutate( ic=se * qt((1-0.05)/2 + .5, n-1)) # computes 95% CI
```

Plot using 2 standard error [at 95% or p=0.05 level]. Note: errors don't overlap for Loach but do for Bullhead.
```{r}
ggplot(pred_sum, aes(x=species, y=mean, fill=treatment)) +
  geom_bar(position=position_dodge(), stat="identity", colour='black') +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean-2*se, ymax=mean+2*se), width=.2,position=position_dodge(.9)) + 
  labs(x = "Fish species", y = "Prey Density", fill = "Treatment") + theme_bw()
```
Or displayed with confidence intervals - see they don't overlap for loach but are little larger.

```{r}
ggplot(pred_sum, aes(x=species, y=mean, fill=treatment)) +
  geom_bar(position=position_dodge(), stat="identity", colour='black') +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean-ic, ymax=mean+ic),width=.2,position=position_dodge(.9)) + 
  labs(x = "Fish species", y = "Prey Density", fill = "Treatment") 
```
NOTE you need the position=position.dodge function to locate the error bars over the bars.The width function scales the width of the error bar = trying playing with it to see.

Creating and saving a publication ready plot
```{r}
ggplot(pred_sum, aes(x=species, y=mean, fill=treatment)) +
  geom_bar(position=position_dodge(), stat="identity", colour='black') +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean-ic, ymax=mean+ic),width=.2,position=position_dodge(.9)) + 
  theme_bw() + # remove default grey background
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey90","grey50")) + # override colours for treatment making them grey and white bars
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x  = element_text(size=10, colour="black"),
        axis.text.y  = element_text(size=10, colour="black"),
        plot.caption=element_text(hjust = 0)) +
  labs(x = "Species", y = expression(Prey~Density~(m^2)), fill = "Treatment", 
       caption = "Figure 1. Species impacts on prey density in experiment enclosures.\nn = 10 per treatment group (total = 40) ** = p<0.01.\nError bars are 95 and 5% CIs.") +   # \n = new line in caption
  annotate("text", x=2, y=4.2, label= "**") +
  annotate("text", x=1, y=4.2, label= "NS") # to add significant level use the annotate function. Check the aov call for sig levels
```


Save the plot. This will be saved to your current working directory unless you specify somewhere else in the ggsave function.

```{r}
ggsave("Fish_pred_plot.png", height = 15, width=15, units="cm", dpi = 500)
 
```
